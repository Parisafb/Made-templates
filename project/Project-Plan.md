## Title
Analyzing the Impact of Renewable Energy Adoption on CO2 Emissions Reduction

## Main Question
"How has the adoption of renewable energy sources impacted CO2 emissions in European countries over the past decade?"

## Description
This project aims to investigate the relationship between the adoption of renewable energy sources and the reduction of CO2 emissions in European countries. By analyzing historical data on renewable energy adoption and CO2 emissions, we will assess how increases in renewable energy usage contribute to decreasing CO2 emissions. The study will involve statistical analysis to determine the correlation between these factors and identify potential patterns. Understanding this relationship is crucial for developing strategies to mitigate climate change. Through this analysis, we hope to provide insights into how renewable energy adoption influences CO2 emissions reduction.
